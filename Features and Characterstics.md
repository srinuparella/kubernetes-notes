# ðŸš€ Kubernetes â€“ Characteristics & Features  

---

## 1. Characteristics of Kubernetes  
ðŸ‘‰ General qualities/nature of Kubernetes.  

### ðŸ”¹ Zero Downtime Deployment  
- K8s updates applications without interrupting users.  
- **Example:** Facebook updates login service while old version is running â†’ users donâ€™t face downtime.  

### ðŸ”¹ Self-Healing  
- If a pod/container fails, K8s automatically restarts or replaces it.  
- **Example:** If one food delivery server in Swiggy crashes, another one starts automatically â†’ service continues.  

### ðŸ”¹ High Availability  
- Keeps applications running even if some nodes fail, by maintaining replicas.  
- **Example:** Even if one hotel branch closes, customers can still order from other branches.  

### ðŸ”¹ Portability & Extensibility  
- Runs on any cloud/on-prem and supports plugins/APIs.  
- **Example:** Same app runs on AWS, GCP, or your laptop without changes.

## 2. Features of Kubernetes  
ðŸ‘‰ Specific capabilities/functions provided by Kubernetes.  

### ðŸ”¹ Automated Rollouts & Rollbacks  
- Deploys new app versions gradually and reverts if they fail.  
- **Example:** If a new app update crashes, K8s switches back to the old version automatically.  

### ðŸ”¹ Horizontal Scaling (HPA)  
- Increases or decreases pods based on traffic/load.  
- **Example:** At 1 PM, 100k people order from Swiggy â†’ Order service pods scale up automatically.  

### ðŸ”¹ Service Discovery & Load Balancing  
- Exposes pods with DNS names/IPs and distributes traffic evenly.  
- **Example:** Customers hitting facebook.com get routed to healthy servers only.  

### ðŸ”¹ Storage Orchestration  
- Attaches local/cloud storage automatically to pods.  
- **Example:** Photo upload service in Facebook gets storage mounted automatically.
