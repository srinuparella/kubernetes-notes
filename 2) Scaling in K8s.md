## ðŸ“– Definition of Scaling  
Scaling is a **Feature of Kubernetes**.  
It means **increasing or decreasing resources (pods, CPUs, memory, etc.)** to handle changes in demand.  

ðŸ‘‰ It ensures applications can handle **low traffic efficiently** and **high traffic without crashing**.

## ðŸ”„ Types of Scaling in Kubernetes  

### 1. **Horizontal Scaling (HPA â€“ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) âœ…**  
- Adds or removes **pods** based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.  
- **Tech Example:** At 1 PM, 100k people order food on Swiggy â†’ Kubernetes adds more **Order Service pods** automatically.  
- **Restaurant Example:** If 100 customers arrive at lunch, the restaurant hires **more waiters** to handle orders.  

### 2. **Vertical Scaling (VPA â€“ Vertical Pod Autoscaler)**  
- Increases or decreases **resources (CPU/RAM)** of existing pods.  
- **Tech Example:** If a database pod needs more RAM to handle queries, Kubernetes increases its **memory allocation**.  
- **Restaurant Example:** Instead of hiring new waiters, the restaurant gives **extra strength/training** to the same waiter so he can handle more tables.

## ðŸŒŸ Main Difference Between HPA & VPA  

- **Horizontal Scaling (HPA):** Add more workers (**new pods**).  
- **Vertical Scaling (VPA):** Make one worker stronger (**increase CPU/RAM of existing pod**).
