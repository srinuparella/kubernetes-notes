# 📝 Kubernetes Pod: Main Container vs Init Container  

## 🔹 Main Container
- **Definition:**  
  The **actual application container(s)** that run inside a Pod.  

- **Purpose:**  
  They provide the core functionality of your application (like running Nginx, Java app, or database).  

- **Lifecycle:**  
  - Main containers start **only after all init containers have completed successfully**.  
  - They keep running as long as the Pod is alive.  

✅ **Example (Main Container Pod):**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dummypod13
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ct1
    image: alpine:latest
    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["1d"]
```
👉 Here `ct1` (alpine) is the **main container** running `sleep 1d`.

## 🔹 Init Container
- **Definition:**  
  Special containers that **run before main containers** in a Pod.  

- **Purpose:**  
  - Perform setup or initialization tasks.  
  - Ensure dependencies (like DB, services, configs) are ready before main app starts.  

- **Lifecycle:**  
  - Run **sequentially** (one after another).  
  - Must **complete successfully (exit code 0)** before the next init container runs.  
  - Once finished, they **never restart** (unless Pod restarts).  
  - If any init container fails → main containers will **not start**.  

✅ **Example (Pod with Init Containers + Main Container):**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dummypod14
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: init-t1
    image: alpine:latest
    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["1d"]
  - name: init-t2
    image: alpine:latest
    command: ["sleep", "1d"]
  containers:
  - name: mainapp
    image: nginx
```
👉 Here:
- `init-t1` → sleeps for 1 day, then exits.  
- `init-t2` → sleeps for 1 day, then exits.  
- Only **after both init containers finish**, the main container (`nginx`) will start.

## 🔎 Main Container vs Init Container (Interview Points)

| Feature              | Main Container 🟢 | Init Container 🔵 |
|----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Purpose              | Runs the **application** (Nginx, DB, API) | Runs **setup tasks** before app |
| Execution            | Run **in parallel** (if multiple containers) | Run **sequentially** (one after another) |
| Lifecycle            | Long-running | Run once, then exit |
| Restart Policy       | Restart if fails | Retries until success |
| Dependency           | Depend on init containers to complete | Must succeed before main starts |

## 🗨️ Interview-Ready Answer

> **Q: What is the difference between main container and init container in Kubernetes?**  
>
> **A:**  
> - Main containers are the actual app containers that keep running and provide business logic (like Nginx, Java, MySQL).  
> - Init containers are special containers that run **before** the main containers. They perform initialization tasks like waiting for a service, setting up configs, or running DB migrations.  
> - Init containers run sequentially and exit once complete. If they fail, the main containers never start.  
> - In my practice, I created a Pod (`dummypod13`) with a **main container only**, and another Pod (`dummypod14`) with **two init containers** (sleep tasks) before starting the main app (nginx).
