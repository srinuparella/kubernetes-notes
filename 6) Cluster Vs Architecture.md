What is difference between Cluster && Architecture ?
                      (Or)
In k8s Cluster && Architecture is same ?

Ans:-

Cluster â‰  Architecture â€” they are related but not the same.
-------
Cluster
-------

-->A Kubernetes cluster is the actual running environment.

-->It is the group of machines (nodes) working together â†’ Control Plane + Worker Nodes.

Example: If you set up Kubernetes on 1 master and 3 workers, thatâ€™s your cluster.

------------
Architecture
------------

-->Architecture is the design or blueprint of how Kubernetes components are organized and how they interact.

-->It shows which components exist (API server, etcd, kubelet, containerd, etc.) and how they connect.

Example: A diagram showing Control Plane components vs Worker Node components is Kubernetes architecture.

âœ… Simple Difference

Cluster = the real, working setup (your servers + containers running).

Architecture = the diagram/design explaining how the cluster is structured.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like this:

Cluster = your actual office with employees working.

Architecture = the office blueprint showing where departments and teams sit.
